FAST tutorial
=============

FAST is a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) dynamic analysis code developed
by NREL that simulates the deflections, motions, and loading of a defined wind
turbine design in specified wind conditions. FAST can be incredibly useful in
the design and analysis of many aspects of the wind turbine, such as the blade,
tower, nacelle, platform, and generator, to name a few.

The purpose of this tutorial is to help those unacquainted with FAST quickly
become familiar with it and how it can benefit their research related to
wind turbine design. This tutorial is specifically targeted for FASTv7_, though
some material included here may be helpful for those using other versions,
such as _FASTv8 and _OpenFAST.
